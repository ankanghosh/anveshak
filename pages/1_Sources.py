# Introduction
st.markdown("""
Anveshak draws from a rich tapestry of spiritual wisdom found in classical Indian texts, 
philosophical treatises, and the teachings of revered Saints, Sages, Siddhas, Yogis, and Spiritual Masters across centuries.
The knowledge presented here spans multiple traditions, schools of thought, and spiritual lineages
that have flourished in the Indian subcontinent and beyond.

Note that the sources consist of about 133 digitized texts, all of which were freely available over 
the internet (on sites like archive.org). Many of the texts are English translations of original 
(and in some cases, ancient) sacred and spiritual texts. All of the copyrights belong to the 
respective authors and publishers and we bow down in gratitude to their selfless work. 
Anveshak merely re-presents the ocean of spiritual knowledge and wisdom contained in the 
original works with relevant citations in a limited number of words.

See *Home* in the navigation menu for our Thank You Note for the authors and *Publishers* for acknowledgments.

### Primary Teachers
The following Indian Saints and Masters constitute the core source of teachings in Anveshak (in no particular order):

≈örƒ´ Caitanya, Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Sri Ramana Maharshi, Sri Nisargadatta Maharaj, 
Paramhansa Yogananda, Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, Shri Lahiri Mahashaya, Sri Aurobindo, 
Sri Sri Ma Anandamayi, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami PrabhupƒÅda, 
Baba Neeb Karori (Neem Karoli Baba), Baba Lokenath, Shri Sai Baba, Bhagawan Nityananda, 
Swami Muktananda, and Swami Sivananda.

Although we genuinely wanted to have the insights from the teachings and stories of Shri Devraha Baba, but not enough information was available about the ageless Siddha Yogi.

### Other Saints
Note that while we have a strong list of Saints that influence this work, availability of 
literature and information encompassing the works of a majority of the ancient Saints are limited. 
Therefore, the teachings and works of the aforementioned primary Spiritual leaders and Saints form the core 
of Anveshak. While methods differ, the works of all of the Saints and Sages reflect a common path,
truth, and God, and therefore, Anveshak does not miss out on any important aspect of spirituality.

Comprehensive list of all of the revered Saints influencing this work (includes) follows the section *The Hidden Ones*. 
Note that Anveshak primarily relies on the works and stories of Indian Saints, Sages, Siddhas, and Yogis. However, 
we have also covered some of the revered Spiritual Masters across other traditions and regions.

Additionally, there are and there have been many other great Saints, enlightened beings, Sadhus, Sages, and Gurus who have worked 
tirelessly to uplift humanity and guide beings to their true SELF and path, of whom little is known and documented. We thank them 
and acknowledge their contribution to the world.

### The Hidden Ones
We acknowledge the boundless grace, love, compassion, and kindness, of the great Saints and Siddhas who took on a physical body 
to selflessly bless beings and guide them to the path to spirituality and the Lord. However, Saints are not required 
to come to the physical plane for continuing with their work. We would like to take a moment to thank all of those 
great beings, the enlightened ones, who visisted the physical world but remanined reclusive while working on their 
paths, and the ones who never had to take a physical bode, for their invaluable contributions and divine guidance.
