    It is believed that one cannot be in a spiritual path without the will of the Lord. One need not be a believer or a non-believer, merely proceeding to thoughtlessness and observation is enough to evolve and shape perspectives. But that happens through grace. It is believed that without the will of the Lord, one cannot be blessed by real Saints, and without the will of the Saints, one cannot get close to them or God.

    **The Saints, Sages, Siddhas, Yogis, Sadhus, Rishis, Gurus, Mystics, and Spiritual Masters** of all genders, backgrounds, traditions, and walks of life whose timeless wisdom illuminates Anveshak. From ancient Sages to modern Masters, their selfless dedication to uplift humanity through selfless love and spiritual knowledge continues to guide seekers on the path.
    
    **The Sacred Texts** that have preserved the eternal truths across millennia, offering light in times of darkness and clarity in times of confusion.
    
    **The Publishers** who have diligently preserved and disseminated these precious teachings, making them accessible to spiritual aspirants worldwide. Their work ensures these wisdom traditions endure for future generations.
    
    **The Authors** who have dedicated their lives to interpreting and explaining complex spiritual concepts, making them accessible to modern readers.
    
    This application is merely a humble vessel for the ocean of wisdom they have shared with the world. We claim no ownership of these teachings - only profound gratitude for the opportunity to help make them more accessible.

### About Anveshak

**General:** Anveshak (meaning "seeker" in Sanskrit) is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that answers questions about spirituality based on insights from Indian 
spiritual texts. It searches through a database of texts to find relevant passages and generates concise answers based on those passages.

**Technical:** The RAG pipeline is powered by an underlying large embedding model that converts texts into searchable 
vector representations (using FAISS indices) and a Large Language Model (LLM) that summarizes and presents the findings of the system.

#### Goal
The path and journey to the SELF is designed to be undertaken alone. The all-encompassing knowledge is internal and not external. 
Not all find the SatGuru - the true, real Guru, for guidance.

It has been observed that all of the necessary knowledge for spiritual progress is available in Indian spiritual texts. 
Additionally, great Saints, Sages, Siddhas, Yogis, Sadhus, Rishis, Gurus, Mystics, and Spiritual Masters of all genders, backgrounds, traditions, and walks of life have imparted spiritual wisdom, 
knowledge, and guidance to beings for ages in the Indian subcontinent and beyond. Anveshak acknowledges and honors these high beings from all backgrounds equally, regardless of gender, caste, creed, or other distinctions.

Our goal is to make a small contribution to the journey of beings toward self-discovery by making this knowledge available and accessible within 
ethical, moral, and resource-based constraints. **We have no commercial or for-profit interests; this application is purely for educational purposes.** 
We sincerely hope this humble offering supports your spiritual progress. God bless.

**Additionally, through this humble effort, we offer our tribute, love, and gratitude to the higher beings ‚Äî the Saints, Sages, and Masters ‚Äî whose works, 
teachings, and wisdom have guided humanity and have inspired and informed this application.**

#### Important to note
- This is not a general chatbot or conversational AI. It is specifically designed to answer spiritual questions with short, concise answers based on referenced texts. It does not generate historical information, reproduce lengthy stories, create lists, or remember past conversations.
- You may receive slightly different answers when asking the same question multiple times. This variation is intentional and reflects the nuanced nature of spiritual teachings across different traditions.
- While you can select a specific number of citations and word limit, the actual response may contain fewer citations based on relevance and availability of information. Similarly, explanations may be shorter than the selected word limit if the retrieved information is concise.
- We apologize for any inconsistencies or misinterpretations that may occur. This application is educational in nature and continuously improving.
- Currently, Anveshak is only available in English.
- We do not save any user data or queries. However, user questions are processed using OpenAI's LLM service to generate responses. While we do not store this information, please be aware that interactions are processed through OpenAI's platform and are subject to their privacy policies and data handling practices.
- **Responses are generated by AI based on the retrieved texts and may not perfectly represent the original teachings, intended meaning, or context.**
- **The inclusion of any spiritual teacher, text, or tradition does not imply their endorsement of Anveshak. We reference these sources with deep respect, but claim no official affiliation.**
- **Anveshak is a tool that is not a substitute for direct spiritual guidance, personal practice, or studying original texts in their complete form. We encourage seekers to pursue deeper learning through traditional means or with the aid of experienced Spiritual Guides and Masters.**

We value your feedback to enhance this application. Please visit the *Contacts* page to share your suggestions or report any issues.
